**DropoutGuard – Online Course Dropout Risk Predictor**

DropoutGuard is a predictive model designed to estimate the risk of a student dropping out of an online learning course based on their engagement.

This project is a machine learning-based predictor that helps identify learners at risk early, enabling instructors and institutions to provide timely interventions such as personalized support, reminders, or additional resources to improve student retention.



🚀 **Importance of This Predictor**

 🟡Early Intervention: Detects students likely to drop out, allowing instructors to take corrective actions.

 🔵Data-Driven Decisions: Uses behavioral and performance indicators (video watch time, quiz performance, forum activity, and assignment submissions) to assess dropout risk.

 🟢Improved Retention: Reduces dropout rates, ensuring more learners successfully complete their courses.

 🟣Scalable Insight: Can be adapted to different online learning platforms and scaled with real datasets.
